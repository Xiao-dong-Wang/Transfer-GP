# Transfer-GP

An adaptive transfer learning algorithm based on Gaussian Process, which can be used to adapt the transfer learning schemes by automatically estimating the similarity between a source and a target task.

The code reimplemented here is from the following paper:
Adaptive Transfer Learning, Bin Cao, et al. AAAI-10
